# Versioned configuration

This is a project template for AEM-based applications. It is intended as a best-practice set of examples as well as a potential starting point to develop your own functionality.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* core: Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* ui.apps: contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS&CSS clientlibs, components, templates, runmode specific configs as well as Hobbes-tests
* ui.content: contains sample content using the components from the ui.apps

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

If you have a running AEM instance you can build and package the whole project and deploy into AEM with  

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage
    
Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackagePublish
    
Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

To version, run
  
    git checkout fda5ce
    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=20160916010001
      
    git checkout 80198    
    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=20160916020002


For an example of a versioned, timestamped pom:

    git checkout version-applied
